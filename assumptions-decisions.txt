- building an e-commerce application using Nodejs/Express for the HTTP request and responses and using PostgreSQL 
    and Sequelize to store and manage data. 
- In a fully function e-commerce application, users should be able to browse contents and see data petaining to content.
    Add products to cart, view cart, and finalize purchase. Application should be allow users to register, login, and or
    browse guest. Members should have their data persisted through user authentication and authorization. Adminstrators should
    be able to manipulate products - create, update, and delete, etc.
- This starter application only has a backend, no frontend. 
- The backend utlizes Nodejs/Express to GET(get), POST(create), PUT(update), DELETE(delete) data using the HTTP protocol. 
    The routes included in this is projects is books, users, and carts.
- The backend also utilizes PostgreSQL/Sequelizes as a relational database management system. A schema design was completed to
    discover the relationships between model. 
- This application does not include authentication/authorization, but a fully functional application would.
- Did research on Kafka, but did not have enough time to integrate correctly in application.
